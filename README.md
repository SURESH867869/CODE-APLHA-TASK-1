An age calculator is a tool or application designed to determine a person's age based on their date of birth and the current date. It provides a quick and convenient way to calculate someone's age accurately without manual calculations. Users typically input their birth date, and the calculator then computes their current age in years, months, and days. Age calculators are commonly used in various contexts, including healthcare, education, legal matters, and personal record-keeping. They streamline the process of determining age, eliminating the need for manual arithmetic and reducing the potential for errors.
